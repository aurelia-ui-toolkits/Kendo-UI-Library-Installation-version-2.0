# Kendo UI Bridge and Library Installation version 2.0

This document explains how to install **[Kendo UI](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui)** library and how to install **[Aurelia Kendo UI Bridge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aurelia-kendoui-bridge)** plugin. Since both these software components are needed in order to use Aurelia KendoUI Bridge as a tool that facilitates building Aurelia components based on KendoUI Library, you need to chose one installation method for the **[Kendo UI Library Installation](./library-installation.html)** and one for the **[Bridge Installation](./bridge-installation.html)**. The subsequent pages in this book explain how to make these choices based on you own preference of Aurelia Development Tools.
