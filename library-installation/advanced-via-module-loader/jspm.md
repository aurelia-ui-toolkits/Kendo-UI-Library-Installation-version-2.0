_Library Installation | Advanced (via module loader)_

# JSPM based KendoUI Library installation

Our new installation process is compliant with Telerik's NPM based installation, with added simplification: in all tutorial samples we always use Kendo UI Professional library

to add the Kendo UI library to the applications that uses the Kendo UI Bridge.

- For SystemJS / JSPM based application, the above command becomes:

```
jspm install npm:@progress/kendo-ui

```
