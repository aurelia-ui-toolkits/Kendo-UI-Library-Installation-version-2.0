# Kendo PRO vs Kendo Core

The free, open source version of **[KendoUI core SDK](http://www.telerik.com/download/kendo-ui-core)** is a subset of the licensed **[KendoUI PRO](http://www.telerik.com/purchase/kendo-ui)**

The **[comparison table](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui/comparison)** gives a good overview between Kendo Core and PRO.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**You are required to purchase a Kendo UI Professional [license](http://www.telerik.com/purchase/kendo-ui) in order to use Kendo UI PRO Library**. However, in the context of this Installation document, we present only the Kendo UI PRO Library installation, with the assumption that you will use it as an evaluation if you do not have the Kendo UI Professional [license](http://www.telerik.com/purchase/kendo-ui) already. Besides the obvious simplification in the installation process, it is also expected that the Bower based installation of Kendo UI Core version will soon not be available any more.
